# Pokemon-Classifier
* Developed a machine learning classifier to distinguish between Legendary and Non-Legendary Pok ́emon on a
dataset with more than 800 entries highlighting the importance of various features.
* Implemented and compared multiple classification models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, AdaBoost,
with feature scaling and hyperparameter optimization using a grid search.
* The model was evaluated using the performance metrics. The accuracies achieved were ranked as follows:
XGBoost ≥ AdaBoost ≥ RandomF orest
